Before starting,I would like to thank Ms. Harmeet singh (http://harmeetsingh13.blogspot.in/2013/03/insert-and-retrieve-images-from-mysql.html) for her wonderfull SQL related tutorials.
So,for inserting images in sql ,first of all you should have sql(any version,i am using my sql) and its driver along with java installed.

SQL query:-
create table image(id varchar(45),size int,image longblob);//long blob is used to store images of size upto 5kb
